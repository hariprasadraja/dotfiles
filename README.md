# Dotfiles for Zsh

This is my personal dotfiles setup. I switch between mac and linux environments (even on wsl in windows), so keeping my worklife inside the terminal is always a challenge. Breaking scripts became a daily occurrence in my life.


I tried to keep a healthy work environment outside of the terminal that suited my entire Backend Development workflow.
